## The Sum of Us: What Racism costs everyone and how we can propser together

By Heather McGhee   

## Notes

McGhee's dominating and powerful image is how city and state governments in the US built public swimming pools as a source of civic pride, but, when the civil rights movement led to enforced integration of the pools, the reaction was to close down the pools (or to privitize them) to prevent Blacks from swimming in them. In the end, this meant that both Blacks and Whites suffered: there were no pools for anyone to swim in.

One of the biggest hurdles to overcoming racial disparities in the US is that many whites see helping minority communities as a zero-sum game: any dollar given to help a Black person must come out of the pocket of a white person. In this view, there is a limited amount of resources that various groups seek to control. Whites have been traditionally in control of the resources, and don't want to cede them to others.

McGhem makes the argument that this is exactly wrong: as the public pools example shows, pools open to everyone benefit everyone. The point is expand resources, not fight over them. This is true _even as_ historical wrongs done to Blacks and other minorities are addressed.

I made a adjacent argument in my essay [Martin Luther King and the “Ghost in the Machine”](https://www.entish.org/published/aighosts.pdf).

Open questions for me: 

- What's the best way to convince my fellow white people that the idea is not just about fairness (which it is, of course) but also good for us all?
- How effective have the programs McGhee highlights been in effecting the kind of change she (I) want to see?
  - [Truth, Racial Healing & Transformation](https://healourcommunities.org) (TRHT) is "a comprehensive, national and community-based process to plan for and bring about transformational and sustainable change, and to address the historic and contemporary effects of racism."
  - [Maine People's Alliance](https://www.mainepeoplesalliance.org/racial_justice) "The mission of Maine People’s Alliance is to create a world where everyone has what they need, contributes what they can, and no one is left behind."
