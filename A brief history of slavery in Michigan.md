# A Brief History of Slavery in Michigan


| Time period        | Description  |
| :-------------: |:-------------|
| Pre-Old World Contact | It is unclear if anyone has done research on enslavement among the Anishinaabe alliance (Ojibwa, Odawa, and Potawatomi) prior to contact with Europeans. Among native Americans on the East Coast, people were taken into forced labor via losses in battle or as a result of raids, both women and men. It was sometimes the case that those who were captured would eventually find a relatively equal status in the capturing community; although, of course, it wasn't their choice to be there in the first place. Sometimes, those enslaved would be traded for goods, or perhaps as part of prisoner swaps. [[1]](#1), [[2]](#2). |

> [T]he prejudice of race appears to be stronger in the states that have abolished slavery than in those where it still exists; and nowhere is it so intolerant as in those states where servitude has never been known .... Thus the Negro is free, but he can share neither the rights, nor the pleasures, nor the labor ... of him whose equal he has been declared to be; and he cannot meet him upon fair terms in life or in death. — Alexis de Tocqueville (Democracy in America) http://inside.sfuhs.org/dept/history/US_History_reader/Chapter4/Excerpt%20from%20Democracy%20in%20America%20on%20slavery.htm
