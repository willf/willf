# A Brief History of Slavery in Michigan

| :-------------: |:-------------|
| Pre-Old World Contact | It is unclear if anyone has done research on enslavement among the Anishinaabe alliance (Ojibwa, Odawa, and Potawatomi) prior to contact with Europeans. Among native Americans on the East Coast, people were taken into forced labor via losses in battle or as a result of raids, both women and men. It was sometimes the case that those who were captured would eventually find a relatively equal status in the capturing community; although, of course, it wasn't their choice to be there in the first place. Sometimes, those enslaved would be traded for goods, or perhaps as part of prisoner swaps. [[1]](#1), [[2]](#2). |
