# Notes on _Reading While Black_

_Reading While Black: African American Biblical Interpretation as an Exercise in Hope_  
by Esau McCaulley

Two quotes:

- The Christian is not given a series of deductive proofs that solve the problem of evil to our satisfaction. We are given an act of love that woos us. (p 31)

- [For Isaiah,] piety must bear fruit in justice. (p 58)

From the blurb:

> Reading While Black is a personal and scholarly testament to the power and hope of Black biblical interpretation. At a time in which some within the African American community are questioning the place of the Christian faith in the struggle for justice, New Testament scholar McCaulley argues that reading Scripture from the perspective of Black church tradition is invaluable for connecting with a rich faith history and addressing the urgent issues of our times. He advocates for a model of interpretation that involves an ongoing conversation between the collective Black experience and the Bible, in which the particular questions coming out of Black communities are given pride of place and the Bible is given space to respond by affirming, challenging, and, at times, reshaping Black concerns. McCaulley demonstrates this model with studies on how Scripture speaks to topics often overlooked by white interpreters, such as ethnicity, political protest, policing, and slavery.
>
> Ultimately McCaulley calls the church to a dynamic theological engagement with Scripture, in which Christians of diverse backgrounds dialogue with their own social location as well as the cultures of others. Reading While Black moves the conversation forward.

_Reading While Black_ (RWB) is an important contribution to Biblical theological reflection. Esau McCaulley (EM) is a Black assistant professor of New Testament at (historically white) Wheaton College; his doctoral advisor was NT Wright, the respected white theologian. But EM was brought up in the Black churches that were conservative Biblically while being socially engaged, which EM (I believe) considers to be the normal Black church experience.

EM is writing up against three different theological traditions: the white supremacist evangelical church (which taints the entire American white evangelical movement, to a greater or lesser extent), the white liberal/progressive tradition (which tends to not take the Bible or the Black experience seriously), and the Black progressive tradition (which tends to not take the Bible seriously enough). He does a good job of explaining what these groups lack, and what the "Black Ecclesial Tradition" has to offer instead.

After a suitable introduction, EM uses this tradition to investigate:

- Polcing
- The Political Witness of the Church
- The Bible and the Pursuit of Justice
- The Bible and Black Identity
- The Bible and Black Anger
- Slavery

None of these is given a full treatment; each would require its own book, and EM suggests someone write on policing before he does! The point is to address these topics, but also show how the Black Ecclesial Tradition addresses each of these.

This book has received a lot of awards from mostly white groups, for example, Christianity Today and the Gospel Coalition. And I think its helpful and healthy for white Christians, especially those who take the Bible as authoritative, to read. But EM is writing, I think, mostly for the Black church, and it is an humbling honor to be allowed to read this book, as a white reader.

I am not doing justice to the book, but I am looking forward to hearing more from McCaulley.
